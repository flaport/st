# st - simple terminal
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

## Repository branches
Each branch of this repository (apart from
[master](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/master) and
[upstream](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/upstream)) is
responsible for a single patch to vanilla st.  Each patch was first
applied on the upstream. Then any additional changes, optimizations
and preferences related to the patch were also applied inside the
branch *before* the branches were merged into master. This way
personal adaptations and improvements to each standard patch are kept
seperately allowing *you* to select which adapted patches to apply to
your build of st.

## Requirements
* In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
* In order to have color-emojis in the terminal, you'll want
[libxft-bgra](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxft/-/merge_requests/1)
to be installed.


## Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

```
    make clean install
```


## Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```
    tic -sx st.info
```

See the man page for additional details.
