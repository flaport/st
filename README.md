# st - simple terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

## Patches

Each patch applied to this version of st lives in a separate branch in
this repository. Such a branch can either be a vanilla patch like they
can be downloaded from the suckless website, or a modified patch, or a
completely custom patch. Below you find all the applied patches in the
order they were merged into the master branch of this repository.

#### alpha + xresources

- download [my combined patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream..alpha+xresources.diff) ‚Äß [my alpha patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream..alpha.diff) ‚Äß [my xresources patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream..xresources.diff)
- see [combined branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/alpha+xresources) ‚Äß [alpha branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/alpha) ‚Äß [xresources branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/xresources)

Combining `alpha` with `xresources` only makes sense, because they are
often defined in the same Xresources file. Moreover, I patched the
URXVT escape sequences into it as well. This will make st listen to
pywal updates üí™.

#### newterm

- see [branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/newterm)

Spawn a new terminal in the same folder with `alt+enter` üì∫.

#### copyurl

- download [my customized patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream...copyurl.diff)
- see [branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/copyurl)

Jump between urls visible in terminal with `alt+n` (forward) or
`alt+m` (backward) and copy the url to the clipboard. This patch is
perfect in conjunction with the `openclipboard` patch. I modified the
standard copyurl patch to work with multi-line urls üåê. This patch is
perfect in combination with `openclipboard`.

#### openclipboard

- download [my customized patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream...openclipboard.diff)
- see [branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/openclipboard)

The keybinding `alt+g` opens whatever is on the clipboard with
`xdg-open`üìã. This patch is perfect in combination with `copyurl`.

#### font2

- download [my customized patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream...font2.diff)
- see [branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/font2)

St does not listen to the fallback fonts defined in your fontconfig:
st will only use the first match. Hence to have proper fallback fonts
defined, one needs to define those with the `font2` patch.

## Other branches

#### v3

Should be up to date with master.

#### v2

A very similar build as v3, but _with_ font ligatures.

#### v1

A very similar build as v2 or master but with _all_ the scrollback
patches applied as well.

#### ligatures

- download [my customized patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream...ligatures.diff)
- see [branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/ligatures)

Enable font-ligatures. Note that a ligature-capable font needs to be
defined as your _primary_ st font for this to work. Turns out I don't
actually like ligatures that much, so I disabled it in v3.

#### scrollback

- see my [scroll repository](https://github.com/flaport/scroll)
- download [combined patch](https://github.com/flaport/st/compare/upstream...scrollback.diff)
- see [combined branch](https://github.com/flaport/st/tree/scrollback)

Scrollback is **not** implemented (in v2 and v3) with the scrollback
patch. Instead, a separate tiny (suckless) program, `sroll`, is used
which implements this feature. According to the suckless developers,
this solution is much better than patching the scrollback in st
itself.

However, the scrollback branch (used in v1) is still available in this
repository. This branch contains _all_ the scrollback patches
together.

## Requirements

- In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
- In order to have color-emojis in the terminal, you'll want
  [libxft-bgra](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxft/-/merge_requests/1)
  to be installed.

## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

```
    make clean install
```

## Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```
    tic -sx st.info
```

See the man page for additional details.

## Credits

- The program `st` was based on Aur√©lien APTEL `bt` source code.
